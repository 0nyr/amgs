# Changelog

### Fri 18 March 2022 

While creating a new repo for my new Java GitHub repository, I realized the code for AMGS was in that repo the whole time. So I cleaned this repository, and added the final code for the game.

+ Added a CHANGELOG to keep track of changes.
+ Moved latest **amgs** code from `java` repo to `amgs`.
+ Added a release file for **AMGS** version 1.3 .
